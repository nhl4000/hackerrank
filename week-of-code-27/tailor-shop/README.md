The customer also has specific ideas about how much she wants to pay for each cluster in that for some cluster i, she wants to pay at least a_{i} dollars. In addition, she wants each cluster to contain a distinct number of buttons. And, finally, she wants to minimize her total cost.

Jaime stocks an infinite number of buttons in an infinite number of colors at his shop, and each button costs p dollars. Given n, p, and the amount of money that the customer wants to pay for each respective cluster, help Jaime by finding and printing a long integer denoting the minimum number of buttons he can use to satisfy her request.
